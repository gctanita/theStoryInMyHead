Tanita looked out the window in awe and sorrow at the planet she used to call home. In a couple of minutes, billions of lives will be lost. For 20 agonizing years she had prepared for this moment, every waking and sleeping second.

The last 20 years had been a rollercoaster. Her identity and place in the world had been challenged and shook to the core. She thought she was a human, but what human had the ability to live for more than a couple of billion years? What human had the ability to regress her body to that of an infant? Of course, nothing came without a cost and such a regression meant a form of amnesia, until she re-awakened. Why did she do this a couple of hundreds of years before? She loved humanity, at heart, and she still remembered that she was born of this earth, among the first humans to walk it. Then the lucky encounter had happened, born from misfortune as both Tanita and Crystal were on brink of death, they had faced each other. Tanita saw a creature that was dying and without any thoughts or consideration to her own state, wanted to help out. Crystal saw the primitive creature, on the brink of death, and wanted to help out. As both of their consciousnesses faded their bodies touched one another. A couple of days after that and they awoke, but everything changed, for both of them. Tanita’s understanding and view of the world expanded. She understood more of what was around her. Things around her had names and properties and usages. It was clear what she could safely eat and could not. And as she focused on something, she realized that she knew a lot about it. She explored her surroundings with the curiosity of a child, absorbing and understanding her surroundings. An entire day passed until she remembered that she had been on the brink of death. With a new found panic she started to check herself and mainly the wounds that had been on her stomach. The were old wounds. The girl knew her old wounds and scars were healed and had disappeared. As she was wondering what happened, Crystal started communicating with her. A voice in her head, a friend, a protector, a partner; once Tanita recovered from the shock she realized she would never be alone again.

Looking out the window upon Earth, she smiled. How she first met Crystal was a very dear memory. She had gained more than knowledge and a friend that day. Crystalians were interconnected telepathically and empathically. They were a race that did not know of the concepts of privacy or secrets. It was weird in the beginning for Tanita. Time flew and she got used to it, to the point that she could not understand how the human society that was forming could do it without being interconnected. For Crystalians the greatest punishment was bannishment: all ties were severed with the individual and he was left alone. The pain of losing the connection to the hive, the loneliness always had the same result: death.

As time passed and both Tanita’s and Crystal’s curiosity grew, they decided it’s an itch that has to be taken care of. Regressing the human body a couple of years to remain youth was not that big of an issue. So they came up with a plan to take the regression even further. They chose a family whose child was about to be born dead (or would soon die after birth), and take the place of that child. Most of the Crystalians thought of it as madness. Especially since Crystal will be so exhausted from the process that it would take about 20 years for her to wake up again.

The process was called “reincarnation,” and after the initial trial run made by Tanita and Crystal, it was now a practice among the Crystalians that chose to take a human host. Of course, Tanita stretched the limits, and Crystal would remain asleep even after recuperating. Awakening would be made at the age of 35, upon mortal danger to Tanita or by being awakened by another Crystalian. The last option was only to be used in case of impending planetary disaster.

Unfortunately this is exactly what happened 28 years ago. It was a Tuesday like any other. Tanita in this life was known as Alicya. Funny, this is the name she used in her online gaming and DND campaigns. Since she was little she knew something was off about her. It felt like she did not belong, that there was more to her story. She used to make fun that she was waiting for the mothership to pick her up. She chose to do what it was supposed to do if the AI had no ethical data — act as incorrect as a human, made a mistake in the implementation. She saw herself as the protector of mankind, from software bugs.

As I was saying, it was a Tuesday like any other, a day at the office. Alicya and her team were preparing a new functionality. It was big, it was complex and a lot of things could go wrong. Alicya was excited for the new hunting ground. The functionality would make people’s lives better, and she will be part of it, what could be more exciting than that?! As she and her team lead were preparing to present to the client the technical solution and clarify some points, they passed by another meeting room and Alicya froze in her tracks. She was looking fascinated at the people inside the meeting room (or so it appeared from inside).

Inside the meeting room there were 3 women: a blonde, a brunette, and a redhead, and 2 men. Alicya recognized the 2 men: they were from the top management of the company. It didn’t take long for the people inside the meeting room to take notice of Alicya. The brunette, that seemed to be in charge, blocked Alicya’s field of view, drawing her attention, then invited her inside.

As she entered the room, she could clearly see the men were furious even before. One started apologizing and tried to while multitasking in describing the situation. To their shock, Alicya’s focus was once again on the women. On something in front of the women, to be more exact! The brunette silenced the men with a stern look, then switching her attention said in a calm and somehow sweet and soothing manner:

— What is it child that caught your eye?

Alicya, yet again broken from the spell, looked a bit panicked around the room. She had to explain herself, and she had to do it fast. With a trembling voice she started doing just that.

— Please forgive my... my rudeness and and intrusion — it's just that... how can I explain? It's such a wonderful view... I thought I would be grey and senile before seeing such a wonderful, gorgeous sight!

— What the hell are you doing? roared one of the men.

— The... the... the holographic interfaces... managed Alicya to say barely holding up her tears.

— Go on child, said the woman while silencing the men with a gesture
— The user interface is so intuitive, even if I don’t understand or recognize the writing. Furthermore, they also seem to have a vast array of sensors to enable you to see a heatmap of the human body, voice analysis, pupil reactions. And the flow of information, you are doing what the blonde woman is telling you to do, while she provides both of you with information. If I were to make an analogy — you are the frontend, she is the backend, pointing at the blonde, and she is the database.

The blonde woman smiled, got up from her chair and put a hand on the brunette’s shoulder, signaling her to retreat.
— And you could tell all that just from watching our holographic interfaces?
— Yes… I didn’t mean to intrude… But they are visible and shiny, you know?!

The blonde smiled and did some gestures in the air. The holographic interfaces became visible to the men.
— You are right, and to not make a fool of you, our tech is now visible to all. Curiosity should not be punished, not the ability to see or do something that others cannot. Have I made our position clear, gentlemen? Her tone was calm, yet contained a force in it that clearly stated no objections were to be had.

— So, my name is Golden Seryl Cecile. You may call me Cecile. May I know your name and birthdate?
— Umm… I’m Alicya Thomas. 21 January 1989, umm, but what a strange question?

— And were you born in village Baia?
— Umm… yeah, my mother was on vacation and I came about a little early catching everyone by surprise.

— Thank the light! I have finally found you! I am sorry child, truly I am. But the situation is dire and your input is needed. Look into my eyes.

As Alicya complied, unable to resist, Cecile’s eyes became more bright, her irises turning to a bright blue, almost emitting light. Cecile’s voice grew fainter with sounds that probably were words. Yes, they were ancient words meant to awaken from the reincarnation process. To remind her of her life as Tanita, host of Crystal. Crystal was the Sha’ira of the Crystalians. Both of them were. Voices, feelings, an empty space of the soul being filled. It all came back to her, millenias of memories.

— Cecile, my old friend, what is the matter? What happened in just 30 years for you to need to awaken me?
— Our worst fear will materialize in just 20 years.

---- 

"Tanita", a warm voice came from behind her, waking her up from her memories.
— Are you sure you want to do this? said Cecile with worry in her voice.
— You know as well as I do that I must. You remember the outgrows and what we felt, then as our sisters died. For the good of the many, it is the price I must pay. You will be the Sha’ira in my stead, if I manage to survive this and recover, I will release you of your burden.
said Tanita, while still looking out of the window upon Earth.
— Yes, you are our sha’ira, the strongest amongst us. Leave someone else to do this, pleaded Cecile. Stop this foolish talk! It is precisely because I am the strongest that I must undertake this. Don’t worry, I’m a pain, you won’t get rid of me this easily. I’ve had thousands of reincarnations. It may not be the same thing, but I will survive and adapt. We always have, said Tanita with more confidence than she felt. Of course she knew that Cecile felt that, and she knew the other woman chose to ignore the feeling and take into account only the words.

Cecile guided Tanita where the banishment ceremony was to take place. It was the first time in over a hundred millennia the ceremony was being performed. However it was only a partial banishment, as the strings were cut from Tanita, they were attached to Cecile. At the end of the ceremony the Crystalian race was split into 2: those that had remained on the planet having Tanita as a sha’ira and those on the ships having Cecile as a sha’ira.

The pain Tanita felt was numbing to such a degree she almost did not realize she had already been guided to her pod, and alone in space. Now Tanita’s duty began. She had to shield the ships that had left her behind from the psionic waves of a planet dying from the impact with a planet killer asteroid.

Tanita opened a recorder. She had been a coward, afraid to take her goodbyes in person from her family and friends. They would have weakened her resolve and that would have killed everybody. She knew it was unfair to them, they had did everything in their power to help her and support her. However by doing so, they had also reminded her what she needed to protect.

"I record this message not as Golden Crystal Tanita, the sha’ira of Crystalians, but as Alicya Thomas, born and raised on Earth. I apologize for this. I could not risk wavering in the face of this dangerous task I must undertake. I have to create a shield around the ships and absorb the psionic shocks that will come from Earth as the planet is destroyed. If I don’t succeed in my mission, the spheres that you are on will be affected. Crystalians are vulnerable to loss, and if this is ignored, it would be fatal. What does it have to do with the ships? You might think that even if the Crystalians aboard die, you would still make it somehow. If humanity would have been at the technological level to build its own intergalactic ships without being tainted by Crystalian technology, then perhaps you would be right. However that is not the case, and I will now reveal to you my last secret. I had kept it hidden so you would not have even a fleeting chance of guessing. The ships, the tech… they are all Crystalians. CRYSTALIANS, not Crystalian tech. Each gadget integrated actually contains a Crystalian. Each ship is a group of Crystalians that have united their bodies to keep you safe. And in order for them to do just that, I need to protect them from the psionic waves.

I love you, and I hope to be able to return to you alive and with my mind intact. However most of all — I will do everything in my powers to protect you."

Tanita stopped the recording as tears filled her eyes.

— I do this to ensure you survive, she said in a whisper to the void.

Then she pressed send button and disconnected the communication system. She closed her eyes taking deep breaths and allowed herself to swim in the field generated by those on the planet. She felt everyone, Crystalian, human, bird, fish, creature, insect, tree and plant. There was a lot of fear and panic, but also acceptance and harmony. She expanded her field, ensuring to capture all emotions. She generated bliss to help with the panic and the pain. Then it happened. The asteroid hit Earth and destroyed it. More accurate would be obliterated. Waves of pain washed over Tanita. Pain and loss hitting her in waves. It was unbearable. Hot tears appeared in her eyes as she struggled to maintain the shield. Nothing would pass her.

A few minutes passed, or hours or days, Tanita did not know, but it was quiet and she was alone.

"Crystal?" Tanita asked in her head.

— Still here, but I don’t know for how long.

— Tanita, I think I still have some energy to do a partial reincarnation before I fall into slumber. It won’t be much, probably I’ll get you to the age of 5 if we are lucky. It will give you time to not die of old age on me while I recover, said Crystal.

Tanita set the coordinates of the pod to the rendezvous point and then let Crystal do the partial reincarnation.
